# Loosely Synchronized Rule-Based Planning (LSRP) for Multi-Agent Path Finding with Asynchronous Actions

This repository provides an implementation of the Loosely Synchronized Rule-Based Planning (LSRP) algorithm for solving Multi-Agent Path Finding with asynchronous actions  problems  (MAPF-AA). LSRP is designed to handle a large number of agents by trading off solution quality for scalability. More technical details can be found in [[1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11678)].

## Requirements

* C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later
* CMake (version 2.8.3 or later)
* Make

## Project Structure

* `data/` - Contains a few input files for the toy examples
* `demo/` - Contains a few input files for the command example cases
* `include/` - Contains all header files.
* `source/` - Contains all source files corresponding to the headers.
* `test/` - Contains toy example file that shows how to use the code.


## Installation and Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. `mkdir build/`
3. `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -B build`
3. `cd build/`
4. `make`
5. Run the program with the following command:
   ```sh
   ./lsrp <map_path> <scen_path> <duration_path> <runtime> [swap]
    ```
   To run the program with 10 agents on the specified map and scenario files, and save the results to `visual.xml` with a maximum runtime of 30 seconds and the swap feature enabled, use the following command:
   ```sh
   ./lsrp ../data/warehouse-10-20-10-2-1.map ../data/warehouse-10-20-10-2-1-random-1.scen ../data/duration.txt 30 swap
   ```
    

#### Command Line Arguments
- `<map_path>`: The path to the map file.
- `<scen_path>`: The path to the scenario file.
- `<duration_path>`: The path to the duration file where the durations for each agent is written.
- `<runtime>`: The maximum runtime for the algorithm in seconds.
- `[swap]` (optional): If provided, enables the swap feature.

#### Example 
To run the toy example, use the following command:
```sh
./test_toyexample
```

## Visualization

For visualization of the results, you can use the [Visualizer](https://github.com/ShuaiZhou302/Continuous-MAPF_visualizer).

This Qt framework-based visualizer allows you to load and display the output files generated by this project.
